      <h2>Welcome to Our Love Calculator!</h2>
      <p>
        Are you curious to know the compatibility between you and your partner?
        Look no further! Our Love Calculator is here to give you an indication
        of the potential love match between you and your significant other.
      </p>

      <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>
        Our Love Calculator uses a special algorithm to determine the
        compatibility between two individuals based on their names. Simply enter
        your name and the name of your partner into the fields provided, and hit
        "Calculate" to see your love compatibility score.
      </p>

      <h3>What Does the Score Mean?</h3>
      <p>The love compatibility score ranges from 0% to 100%.</p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that while our Love Calculator can give you an idea of your
        compatibility, it's important to remember that love is complex and
        multifaceted. A high or low compatibility score shouldn't be the sole
        determinant of your relationship's potential.
      </p>

      <h3>Have Fun!</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're in a long-term relationship, just starting to date
        someone new, or simply curious about your compatibility with a crush,
        our Love Calculator is here for you. Have fun exploring your love
        compatibility and remember to cherish the unique connection you share
        with your partner!
      </p>
